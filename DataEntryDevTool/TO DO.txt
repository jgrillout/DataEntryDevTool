** NUMERIC INPUT NOT WORKING NOW


-- FIX F2 WORKING ON ALL FIELDS
--  add f2 allowed & field required
-- consider adding f1 options or 2 lines for choices
0. add more input types
1. rename row to fieldRow & col to fieldCol
2. make varable naming style consistent for camel case
5. logic to test if db already exists and if to overwrite and export to text file?
6. add ability to specify the order by in selectRows
7. Other misc cleanup
8. Should I change the data entry vector to store rest of pointers to each window?
9. Should I change the data entry vector to store "RecordNotFound" etc.
